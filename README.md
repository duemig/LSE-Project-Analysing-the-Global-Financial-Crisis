# LSE Project: Analysing the Global Financial Crisis

Analysing the Global Financial Crisis

Introduction:
The 2007-09 global financial crisis had far-ranging consequences within the global money and capital markets. The crisis, characterized by the extensive failures of large-scale investment banks and unprecedented mortgage delinquencies, caused US equity market declines of over 50 percent from peak (October 2007) to trough (March 2009) and had a notable impact on increasing cross-correlations among different stocks. As indicated by the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), US equity market volatility increased almost ten-fold, from as low as 9.6 in December 2006 to 89.5 in October 2008. This paper assesses how the 2007-2009 global financial crisis affected the market risks associated with a representative sample of ten Standard and Poor's 500 (S&P 500) firms – both financial and non-financial – by evaluating the returns and cross-correlations of their common stocks.
